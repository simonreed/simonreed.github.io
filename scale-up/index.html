      <p>Your product roadmap is bigger than your development capacity, we've all been there. Maybe you should hire a new full time permanent developer but a reliable, experienced developer is hard to come by and even when you find one you might have to wait months for their notice period to end.</p>

      <h2>Your development team can be as scaleable as your AWS.</h2>

      <p>There is a more flexible and faster solution, using a reliable and experience developer, that you can scale up and down.</p>

      <p>Do you need me to help with a project sprint, bring me on board. Then stop using me when you don't need the extra capacity.</p>

      <h2>Experience when you need it</h2>

      <p>While I have a wealth of experience developing complex systems in React and Ruby, you don't need to be tied down to a lengthy and costly contract or permanent employment. My clients enjoy a level of flexibility which means I can scale up and down my involvement to suit their needs. Have a sudden deadline then let me know and once your workload goes back to normal I'll go back into hiatus ready for you when you need me next.</p>

      <h2>Do you have an existing project that needs help meeting it's business objectives?</h2>

      <p>I often have clients approach me needing help on an existing project that isn't going to plan. Whether it's a startup founder who is having trouble with their codebase as their team grows or a business owner who is spending most of the day within their site admin section. I can review your existing project and advise you what steps are required to get it back on track and working for you, rather than the other way around.</p>

      <p>I make people more money. I don't care about writing code for the sake of it, all I care about is how much I can make you. I’ll analyze your business, find the areas that need to be improved and come up with a game plan to boost your business.</p>

      <h2>In this for the long haul</h2>

      <p>One of the biggest issues people find when working with consultants is that they can flake or they quit to join another company full-time. Not with me.</p>

      <p>I’m not just running a side business until a full-time job comes my way. I want to build strong, long-term relationships with great people.  You can rest easy knowing I’ll always be around.</p>
